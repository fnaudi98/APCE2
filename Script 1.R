#How does individual variation in timing relative to caterpillar food peaks affect reproductive performance and its repeatability in pied flycatchers

#q1.1 Do pied flycatchers adjust their arrival and laying dates to match annual variation in caterpillar peak date? and are these dates repeatable? 
#firs model between and within individuals for timing and caterpillar peak dates 
#repeatability plus plastic response - whether they adjust between years
#laying date 0 simplify by using females only

#q1.2 looking at mismatch from peak date and seeing if there is a trend among individuals and looking at what success outcomes we find (clutch size & recruits, maybe mass too? ) 
#mismatch becomes predictor variable and can look at within birds whether in years they are more matched they have a higher fitness. (clutch size and recruits will have same data for males and females  since they breed together, so maybe best to select females in second step.)
#either looka t data separately or put data together and make sex a fixed factor).
